# Investigate-Hotel-Business
Using Data Visualization

## Background
Analyzing business performance is crucial for any company. In this project, I will focus on the hospitality industry, with the aim of examining customer behaviors in hotel bookings, such as the average number of bookings per month and cancellation rates based on various factors. This project includes workflows such as data preprocessing, descriptive statistical analysis, and data visualization.

## Goal
To understand how customers behave when making hotel reservations and how this relates to the cancellation rate of hotel bookings.

## Objective
Insights will be presented through data visualizations to make them easier to understand and more engaging.

## Data
The dataset contains 119,390 rows of data and 29 features, which capture the behavior of customers making hotel reservations.

## Tools Used
In this project, I utilized various tools, including Jupyter Notebook for the platform, Python as the programming language, and a combination of Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization.

## Project Content

**Data Preprocessing**

This step involves identifying missing values, correcting inappropriate values, adjusting data types, and removing unnecessary data rows.

**Monthly Hotel Booking Analysis By Hotel Types**

This includes calculating the average number of hotel bookings per month by hotel type and generating corresponding data visualizations. 

**Impact Analysis of Stay Duration on Hotel Booking Cancellation Rates**

This section calculates the cancellation rate based on the duration of stay and hotel type, generates data visualizations, and identifies trends related to this metric.

**Impact Analysis of Lead Time on Hotel Booking Cancellation Rate**

This includes calculating the cancellation rate based on lead time and hotel type, generating data visualizations, and determining which months have the lowest and highest cancellation rates.

## Conclusion
* According to the analysis, June, July, Aug are the peak seasons for hotel bookings, with the highest average number of bookings compared to other months. However, there is another increase in December, which may be due to school holidays in Indonesia during June and July, and the end-of-year holidays in December.

* Additionally, there is a positive trend in the cancellation rate based on the duration of stay. The longer customers plan to stay, the higher the cancellation rate, possibly due to errors during reservation or the cancellation of vacation plans for urgent reasons.

* Furthermore, a 1-month lead time has the lowest cancellation rate, while an 11-12 month lead time has the highest. The reasons for this trend are similar to those observed in the cancellation rate by stay duration.
